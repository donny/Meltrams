Meltrams

Meltrams is an iPhone app developed specifically to show real-time tram arrival information for trams in Melbourne, Australia. You can specify the Tram Tracker ID and the Tram Number; and the application will give you tram arrival information at that particular tram stop. It was originally released in March 2009. It gets the data from Yarra Trams. It requires the back-end software component: https://github.com/donny/meltrams-back-end. It was developed targeting the iPhone OS version 2.x.
